# Shortest Path Algos
These algos find the shortest path between two points in a graph. There are many different algos in place. Some common ones are

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
There are many variants of Dijkstra's algo, we here talk about the one which produces shortest path to all vertices. It generates SPT(shortest path tree) and finds the shortest path from the sources to all vertices

**More explanation would be updated soon** 
The code can be dound in the folder itself.
